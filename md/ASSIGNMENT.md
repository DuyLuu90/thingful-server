# LEARNING A NEW CODEBASE:
    async vs await:
        async: contain 0 or more <await> expression
        await: suspend progress through an async function, yielding control and subsequently resuming progress only when an awaited promosied-based asynchronous opt is either fulfilled or rejected
    db.raw && DISTINCT && author:

    transaction():
        fundamental concept of all db system, bundles multiple steps into a single operation (all or nothing)
        take-away: complete or nothing, permanently recorded, invisible to other transaction.
        How does it relate to BEGIN and COMMIT in Postgres?
            BEGIN start the transaction
            COMMIT end the transaction
    sequence table:
        sequence: is a ordered list of integers. It is a special type of data, used to generate unique numeric identifiers. 
        Syntax:
            CREATE SEQUENCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sequence_name
                [ AS { SMALLINT | INT | BIGINT } ]
                [ INCREMENT [ BY ] increment ]
                [ MINVALUE minvalue | NO MINVALUE ] 
                [ MAXVALUE maxvalue | NO MAXVALUE ]
                [ START [ WITH ] start ] 
                [ CACHE cache ] 
                [ [ NO ] CYCLE ]
                [ OWNED BY { table_name.column_name | NONE } ]
        sequence table: table objects created with CREATE SEQUENCE
        Syntax: 
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST <tableName> (
                <columnName> SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            )
    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY:
        PRIMARY KEY: special column contain unique value
        SERIAL: 
            create a sequence obj->set the next value generated by the sequence as the default val
            ->add NOT NULL constrain to primary key column
        Syntax:
            CREATE TABLE <tableName> (<columnName> SERIAL);
    RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE
        RESTART IDENTITY: automatically restart sequences owned by columns of the truncated table
        CASCADE: automatically truncate all have foreign-key ref to any of the named table
        RESTRICT: refuse to truncate if any of the tables have foreign key references from tables not listed in the command
    SELECT setval()

# PROTECTED ENDPOINTS:
    Public:
        The GET /api/things 
    Basic auth:
        The GET /api/things/:thing_id 
        The GET /api/things/:thing_id/reviews 
        The POST /api/reviews endpoint (automatically assign a user_id)
    PrivateRoute:
        If a user attempts to view the login form when they're already logged in, they should be redirected to the thing list page.
        If a user tries to view reviews for a thing, they should be redirected to the login form page.
        
    The thingful-client should store the base64 encoded credentials when the login form is submitted.
    The base64 encoded credentials should be sent in requests to protected endpoints.
    

    CLIENT:
        thing-api-service.js: 
            headers: {
                //Authorization: `Schema ${userName}:${password}
                'authorization': `basic ${TokenService.getAuthToken}`,
            }
    SERVER:
        app.js:
            const app= new Server();
            app.post('',()=>{

                Database.findUser({})
            })
        middleware/basic-auth.js

                console.log(req.get(`Authorization`))
                const authToken = req.get(`Authorization`) || ''
                if (!authToken.toLowerCase().startWith('basic')){
                    return res.status(401).json({error:`Missing basic token`});
                }
                next()
            }
