# LEARNING A NEW CODEBASE:
    async vs await:
        async: contain 0 or more <await> expression
        await: suspend progress through an async function, yielding control and subsequently resuming progress only when an awaited promosied-based asynchronous opt is either fulfilled or rejected
    transaction():
        fundamental concept of all db system, bundles multiple steps into a single operation (all or nothing)
        take-away: complete or nothing, permanently recorded, invisible to other transaction.
        How does it relate to BEGIN and COMMIT in Postgres?
            BEGIN start the transaction
            COMMIT end the transaction
    sequence table:
        sequence: is a ordered list of integers. It is a special type of data, used to generate unique numeric identifiers. 
        Syntax:
            CREATE SEQUENCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sequence_name
                [ AS { SMALLINT | INT | BIGINT } ]
                [ INCREMENT [ BY ] increment ]
                [ MINVALUE minvalue | NO MINVALUE ] 
                [ MAXVALUE maxvalue | NO MAXVALUE ]
                [ START [ WITH ] start ] 
                [ CACHE cache ] 
                [ [ NO ] CYCLE ]
                [ OWNED BY { table_name.column_name | NONE } ]
        sequence table: table objects created with CREATE SEQUENCE
        Syntax: 
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST <tableName> (
                <columnName> SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            )
        Link: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-createsequence.html 
    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY:
        PRIMARY KEY: special column contain unique value
        SERIAL: 
            create a sequence obj->set the next value generated by the sequence as the default val
            ->add NOT NULL constrain to primary key column
        Syntax:
            CREATE TABLE <tableName> (<columnName> SERIAL);
    RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE
        RESTART IDENTITY: automatically restart sequences owned by columns of the truncated table
        CASCADE: automatically truncate all have foreign-key ref to any of the named table
        RESTRICT: refuse to truncate if any of the tables have foreign key references from tables not listed in the command
    SELECT setval('sequence_name',nextVal):
        Set the next value for the next sequence
        The result returned by SETVAL() is next_value or NULL if the given next_value and round is smaller than the current value.

# PROTECTED ENDPOINTS:
    Public:
        The GET /api/things 
    Basic auth:
        The GET /api/things/:thing_id 
        The GET /api/things/:thing_id/reviews 
        The POST /api/reviews endpoint (automatically assign a user_id)
    PrivateRoute:
        If a user tries to view reviews for a thing, they should be redirected to the login form page.
    PublicOnlyRoute:
        If a user attempts to view the login form when they're already logged in, they should be redirected to the thing list page.

    The thingful-client should store the base64 encoded credentials when the login form is submitted.
    The base64 encoded credentials should be sent in requests to protected endpoints.
    

    

# DATA PROTECTION:
    Implement the logout button functionality to clear the token in local storage:
        components/Header/header.js:
            + TokenService.clearAuthToken()
    Update db seeding data to use hashed passwords, using bcrypt
    update basic-auth middleware to use bcrypts to compare the password in the basic token with the hash

# SECURE LOGIN:
    Create a POST/login endpoint that responds with a JWT(JSON Web Tokens)
    Update login form to store the JWT from the res in local storage 
    Change middleware to verify the JWT instead of verifying the base64 encoded basic auth header

# USER REGISTRATION:
    REQUIREMENTS:
        Unique, between 8-72 characters, shouldn't start or end with spaces
        Contains at least 1 lower case letter, 1 number, 1 special character
        full_name is required, nickname is optional 
    HAPPY PATH:
        read req body-> validate fields->bcrypt the password->insert the user into the db
        send response:
            201 with the response location of the new user's id
            the res body should contain a serialized respresentation of the user, no pass down
            the user should have also had a date_created field auto-populated
